        <p><em>Husband | Father | Future Programmer?</em></p>
        <p>I'm an interesting character. The majority of my passions seem to change
          frequently. Those that stick don't seem to be feasible for bread-winning.
          With that said, I believe I'm at a point as I've just entered my 30th year,
          I want to do my work, punch the clock, and then be present with my loved ones.
          I understand it's important I enjoy the work I do to provide, but I also need
          security in income. Here I am coding a website. Is this the 9-5 that will bring
          home the bacon, but still allow me to grow, problem-solve, and create? I look
          forward to learning. I like computers. I like knowing how things work. Join me
          to see what I create.</p>
